                            <strong>Introduction</strong><br />The aim of a good
                            test plan is to try and find bugs in a program. If a
                            program can't be failed and errors can't be found
                            then the programmer can be reasonably certain that
                            the program works. Writing test plans that prove a
                            program works is incredibly difficult. When programs
                            are thousands and thousands of lines of code long,
                            it is difficult to test every path through the code,
                            to ensure that every path through it works as
                            intended. Formal test strategies, however, improve
                            the chances of finding bugs.

                            This kind of testing can be done either by the
                            programmers who wrote the code or some people
                            employed specifically to test software. This type of
                            testing is known as 'white box testing' or 'glass
                            box testing'. The test plan is based upon the
                            structure and design of the actual code. The person
                            who writes the test plan can actually see the code.
                            Consider this example to calculate an exam mark
                            comment. You have some pseudo-code with lots of
                            nested IF statements.

                            Because the tester can see this code they will know
                            that, to ensure they test every bit of the code
                            (every path through the code), they must try:
                          </p>
                          <ul>

                                  a value greater than or equal to 100 but less
                                  than 200.
                                </li>

                                  a value greater than or equal to 200 but less
                                  than 300.

                            They can, of course, only design the tests for white
                            box testing once the code has been written! It’s
                            possible for bugs to be discovered in a program
                            years after it was first used because a particularly
                            unusual path through the code was not tested. It is
                            almost impossible to test every path in a big
                            program, especially, for example, when many nested
                            IF statements are used.

                              >Black box testing is so described because the
                              code is viewed as being inside a black box, or
                              unreadable. The tester has no knowledge of the
                              code. This kind of test plan should be written
                              before the program is written. This is possible
                              because you are not testing the code as such but
                              testing to see if the program can do what it was
                              written to do, as laid down in a Requirements
                              Specification. The focus is on the functionality
                              of the program. For this reason, the tests will be
                              written so that data is inputted via the
                              interfaces provided and the outputs observed to
                              see if what was predicted would happen actually
                              does happen.</span

                            testing, a plan should use a range of data to
                            produce a range of results. The programmer would:

                                  Compare the prediction with the actual results
                                  and comment on whether the test passed or
                                  failed.

                            When deciding what data to use, the programmer would
                            consider the following categories of input data:
                          </p>

                            </li>

                            example. Invalid data might include -30. Extreme
                            data might include 560444033. Mad data would be of a
                            completely different data type, 'Gr', for example.
                            Although no code is shown in our program to cope
                            with this invalid data type of input, we would
                            expect there to be some in a real program. We would
                            want to observe an "invalid input" message if this
                            case occurred. Borderline data would include 99,
                            100, 101, 199, 200, 201, 299, 300 and 301, for
                            example, with observations of the correct output in
                            each case.

                            You have been given the subroutine by the programmer

                            <strong>Alpha testing</strong><br />Software can be
                            fully or partially written and then tested using
                            black box and white box testing. Whether complete or
                            only partially complete, the code is passed to a
                            restricted audience within the company that produced
                            the software, possibly a Testing Department set up
                            for the purpose of testing software products. They
                            will use it and give feedback to the programmers.
                            They will report any faults they find, make comments
                            about the ease of use of the software and suggest
                            improvements, for example. This kind of testing is
                            known as ‘alpha testing’. It is used to further
                            improve a product and to help track down bugs.

                            <strong>Beta testing</strong><br />Once a product
                            has been alpha tested, it can then be improved and
                            'finished off'. It is released to a limited audience
                            in return for their feedback. The audience might
                            include reviewers, special customers and people who
                            write textbooks about software products. This
                            information can be used to further improve the
                            quality of the final product before it is finally
                            released and sold as a finished program to an
                            awaiting public. This kind of testing is known as
                            ‘beta testing’.

                            <strong>Unit testing</strong><br />Whenever a module
                            of code (or subroutine, or unit, or function, or
                            procedure, or whatever other name you want to give
                            to the block of self-contained code) is written, it
                            needs to be tested. Testing can be done using black
                            or white box testing, as discussed earlier. Whether
                            you use black box or white box testing, testing an
                            individual module of code is known as ‘unit
                            testing’.

                            <strong>Integration testing</strong><br />Once
                            modules of code are tested using unit testing, they
                            need to be combined and tested together. It is
                            possible that two fully tested modules (tested
                            individually using unit testing) will produce a
                            problem when they are combined and asked to work
                            together. Bringing modules together and checking
                            that there are no unintentional problems is known as
                            ‘integration testing’.

                            <strong>Identifying programming errors</strong
                            ><br />Once an error in a program has been
                            discovered, whether it is a syntax error, a logical
                            error or a run-time error, whether it has been
                            discovered during white box testing, black box
                            testing, alpha testing or beta testing, the program
                            needs to be debugged! This can sometimes be easier
                            said than done. Fortunately, there are tools to
                            help! Programming languages usually come with
                            debugging programs. These are software tools for the
                            programmer to use to help find bugs.

                            <strong>Translator diagnostics</strong><br />When
                            some source code is translated, what actually
                            happens is that the source code is passed over to a
                            program called a 'translator'. The translator checks
                            each line in turn against the rules of the language.
                            You will know from experience that programming
                            instructions using keywords must be written in
                            exactly the correct way. If there is any deviation
                            from the rules in the way an instruction is
                            constructed then an error will be reported. This is
                            known as a syntax error. An appropriate error
                            message would be displayed on the screen and the
                            location of the error in the program would be
                            highlighted. Unfortunately, the exact position of
                            the error is not always obvious from the information
                            given by the translator diagnostics program and the
                            error messages given can be rather cryptic
                            sometimes. Translator diagnostics do, however, help
                            a programmer locate syntax errors in a program.

                            <strong>Dry run</strong><br />A section of a program
                            that a programmer suspects of having an error might
                            be 'dry run'. This involves the programmer copying
                            out a list of instructions from the program into a
                            table on paper. This table is known as a ‘trace
                            table’. The programmer then adds columns for any
                            variables that are important for this part of the
                            code. When this has been done, the programmer works
                            through the program on paper, line by line, filling
                            into the trace table the values of variables as they
                            change. By doing this, the programmer can spot the
                            exact position when things start going wrong with
                            the program - when variables suddenly contain
                            unexpected values. Trace tables can be done on
                            computer but it is more usual to do it on paper by
                            hand - programmers seem to be able to find problems
                            more efficiently this way.

                            <strong>Watch and Trace</strong><br />It is possible
                            for a programmer to tell the computer to display (or
                            'watch') certain variables in a program. The
                            programmer can then step through the program
                            line-by-line (or 'trace' through the program)
                            watching the variables as they change. This is a
                            little like doing a dry run on paper. This tool,
                            however, is very powerful when used with the
                            breakpoint tool described below.

                            <strong>Breakpoints</strong><br />Consider a program
                            that has 10000 thousand of lines of code. A
                            programmer trying to track down a fault is confident
                            that the first 8000 lines are fine but suspects the
                            problem lies somewhere after line 8000. They can set
                            a 'breakpoint' at line 8000 and then run the
                            program. The program will run from the beginning of
                            the program right up to line 8000 and will then
                            stop. At that point, the programmer can then examine
                            the contents of the variables they have told the
                            computer to 'watch'. When they have done that they
                            will either have spotted the problem and will set
                            about correcting it or they will set the program
                            running to the next breakpoint. They could also
                            'watch and trace' from that breakpoint.

                            <strong>Cross-referencing</strong><br />This
                            debugging tool identifies every place that a
                            particular variable occurs. This is useful, because
                            it allows the programmer to check that each variable
                            has been named correctly and that one variable name
                            hasn't been used for two different things.

                            <strong>Bottom-up testing</strong><br />When
                            programs are designed using the top-down approach,
                            it means that a big problem is split up into lots of
                            smaller problems and a program, or ‘module’, is then
                            written for each problem. Each of the modules
                            produced should ideally perform one task. When a
                            program is being tested, the smaller modules are
                            each tested individually first. They are then
                            combined with other modules and they are tested
                            together. These are then combined with even more
                            modules, and tested, until the whole program has
                            effectively been rebuilt and completely tested.
                            While a problem is designed using a top-down
                            approach, testing is done using a bottom-up
                            approach. This makes it easier to find faults. It is
                            easier to find faults in lots of smaller blocks of
                            code and then recombine them than trying to find
                            bugs in one big block of code.
