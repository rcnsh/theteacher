<h1 style="text-align: center;">More on Database Management Systems (DBMS)</h1>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong class="NormalContentHeading">Introduction<br> </strong>A database can become very complicated very quickly. With many tables, many pieces of information, many queries and many people wanting to access the data, it becomes necessary to have a way of managing the database and everything to do with it. We call the software that manages a database the Database Management System, or DBMS.</p>
 
<p class="NormalContent"><strong class="NormalContentHeading"> Access Rights, Views and the role of the DBMS.</strong><br> Consider a relational database in a company. It is one database of related tables that serves the entire business. However, you do not want everyone having access to all the data in the system at all times from all computers. It would be a breach of the Data Protection Act for one thing! You would not want your personal details available to anyone who felt like looking them up for another. In addition, Information in companies, especially financial information, is valuable and therefore needs to be restricted. You want to be able to limit who can access what, at what times and from where. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li class="NormalContent">The receptionist should be able to see who works for the company and his or her telephone extension but not personal details of each employee.</li>
<li class="NormalContent">The personnel manager should be able to view, add, delete or amend an employee's details, but not be able to read the sales figures for a company.</li>
<li class="NormalContent">A salesman should be able to view all orders, create new ones and view his own sales figures, but not view other people's sales figures, or the total sales figures.</li>
<li class="NormalContent">The senior management should have the right to view any salesman's sales figures.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong><span class="NormalContentHeading">The role of the DBMS</span></strong><br> Restricting access to data is done through the DBMS (See DDL in the next section). This is a piece of software that, amongst other things, provides an interface for the database administrator to allocate 'views' and 'rights' to individuals or groups of individuals. There are a number of things an administrator could do to a user or group of users using the DBMS.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li class="NormalContent">A user or group could only be allowed to 'view' certain records but not others.</li>
<li class="NormalContent">A user or group could be allowed to both view certain records and modify them but not others.</li>
<li class="NormalContent">A user could be allowed to delete certain kinds of records but not others.</li>
<li class="NormalContent">A user could be allowed to execute certain programs but not others.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong class="NormalContentHeading">Setting up groups and making an individual account holder a member of groups</strong><br>Typically, a Database Administrator will define a set of groups, each with their own rights. For example, if the organisation were a school, then there might be a group called Students, another called Teachers, another called Finance Department, another called Senior Teachers, another called Special Needs Department and so on. Each of these groups will be set up so that they are able to access only those parts of the data that they need to do their job and nothing else. When an account for a new user is created, they will be given a user ID and a password but they will also be added to one or more of the groups that have been set up. The result of this is that the individual account holder inherits the view of data and any rights to access, view, delete, amend or add to that data that the groups they are now members of have been given.</p>
<p class="NormalContent">When a user correctly logs on using the User ID and Password, their rights and views are accessed by the DBMS. They will only be able to get to the views of data that they have been allocated with and will only be able to use the rights they have been given.</p>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong>Security</strong><br>It is possible for individual files to have extra security, for example by being password-protected. The user will then have to correctly enter a password to access those files. This is useful to prevent casual access to a computer that has been left unattended but not correctly logged out. As an additional security method, users can be logged out automatically after a period of inactivity.</p>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong>Backing-up data</strong><br>Databases and the data they hold are very valuable. They take a long time to design and the data in them may have been collected over many years. It is important therefore to protect the data. This is done by backing it up regularly and keeping the back-ups safe. Typically, full back-ups of the whole system and data are done periodically, perhaps once a week, and incremental back-ups are done at least once a day and often many times a day. An incremental back-up is one where the only files that are backed up are the ones that have been added or changed since the last back-up was done.</p>
<p class="NormalContent">The DBMS can be used to automatically schedule when the back-ups are done in accordance with an organisation's written back-up policy. Back-ups are typically done to a magnetic tape device, although backing-up off-site to cloud storage is becoming increasingly more common. The only job left for the Database Administrator is to check periodically that the back-ups are being correctly done. They should, for example, restore a complete back-up on a separate computer system once a month, to check that the back-up system is correctly working.</p>
<p><strong>Back-up policy</strong><br>All data is at risk at all times. There are many reasons why this is so. A hacker or disgruntled employee may delete data, there could be a fire, data might get corrupted by software or an upgrade, a piece of equipment like a hard drive might fail, there might be an earthquake or other natural disaster, someone might steal a computer with data on and so on. To ensure that data can be recovered, it is backed-up regularly. However, a policy is written down to make it crystal clear;</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>whose job it is to do the back-ups</li>
<li>how often the back-ups will be made and when it will be done</li>
<li>how each back-up is to be made</li>
<li>how each back-up will be labelled</li>
<li>where back-ups will be stored</li>
<li>how the back-up system will be tested</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Back-ups are usually done on a rolling basis. For example, in the first week of a four week back-up plan, an 'incremental back-up' might be made every night on a back-up tape called Monday1, Tuesday1, Wednesday1, and Thursday1. An incremental back-up resaves only those files that have changed since the last time a back-up was made. On the Friday, a 'full back-up' is made of the whole system' data on a tape called Friday1.</p>
<p>Then the above is repeated for the next week on tapes called Monday2, Tuesday2, Wednesday2, Thursday2 and Friday2, so you now have 10 tapes). The same is done for week three and week four (so you have 20 tapes now). Then at the start of the new four week period, the tapes are over-written and the whole process restarts.</p>
<p>The above policy might be fine for a small organisation. For larger ones, you would probably keep back-ups going back many months or even years. The reason why so many back-ups are made is that it might actually take a few weeks or months to detect that there was a problem with the back-up system. If you used just one tape and backed up a computer every day on that one tape, it would be a real problem if you discovered, for example, that the back-up device hadn't been working correctly for a few weeks or a back-up tape was faulty.</p>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong class="NormalContentHeading">Locking</strong><br> Databases occasionally need to be 'locked'. This is important when multiple users potentially have access to the same file at the same time. For example, if a file is being updated by User A, you don't want User B accessing the file until User A has finished with it. Reserving a file is known as 'locking' and ensures that the integrity of the file contents is not compromised. An example of a file needing to be locked is in a real time booking system. You wouldn’t want two different booking agents who book cinema tickets booking the same seat at the same time! This will lead to overbooking. One of them must have the right to modify the file and to book tickets. The other agent should have the right to look at the current seat availability, but not the right to book seats, until the file has been updated and released as a result of any bookings taken by the first booking agent.</p>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong class="NormalContentHeading">More on the Database Management System (DBMS)</strong><br> If you have used Access, or any other main relational database software, then you have used a DBMS. In Access, the kinds of things you will have done are varied. You may have used the special window to design tables, or you may have designed them using SQL. You might have entered data directly into the tables in ‘data sheet view’. You could have spent some time designing forms and entered the data in that way. You may have used QBE to design a search for information or again used SQL. Whichever way you used, you probably presented the findings using a report. All of these functions are provided by the DBMS.</p>
<p class="NormalContent">In general, a DBMS is a piece of software that lets you create, manipulate and maintain a database. It lets you:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li class="NormalContent">Set up tables of data about data (technically called 'meta-data'. You may also know it as the 'data dictionary'.)</li>
<li class="NormalContent">Create forms to enter data.</li>
<li class="NormalContent">Create accounts and rights for users and groups of users.</li>
<li class="NormalContent">Do queries on data.</li>
<li class="NormalContent">Present data in various report formats.</li>
<li class="NormalContent">Provide a programming language to let you do extra-clever things.</li>
<li class="NormalContent">Provide you with the ability to set up different 'views' of data.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="NormalContent">Above all, the DBMS provides users with a ‘conceptual view of data’. In other words, it provides the user with a user interface that they can understand and relate to, for example, a picture of tables of data related to each other (an E-R diagram) or a table of data showing the name of each piece of data, their data type, the validation rules and so on. Data is not stored like this on disk! In fact, the data might be stored in indexed files, linked lists or sequential files, for example. This is the ‘physical view of the data’, which humans cannot understand. To make use of the data on disk they need it to be interpreted and shown in a form they can understand. This is what the DBMS software does. It provides a user interface!</p>
<p class="NormalContent">Broadly speaking, there are two main functioning parts to a DBMS. These are the DDL and the DML.</p>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong class="NormalContentHeading">Data Definition Language (DDL)</strong><br> The Data Definition Language (DDL) is one part of the DBMS. It is used by the designer of a database rather than a user. The DDL is used to set up the structure of a database as well as for maintaining the database. For example, using the DDL, they can set up tables of data about data (names of attributes, data types, validation rules etc). The data about data is often called ‘meta-data’. The DDL is also used to set up the security systems in the database. This is done using the DDL by describing the whole database (the ‘schema’) and then describing data in <em>parts</em> of the database (the ‘sub-schema’). Once this has been done, the designer can control access to each of the sub-schema. For example, if a receptionist needs to know each employee’s department, extension and job title, then a sub-schema will be defined with these data items in it. The receptionist is then given access to that sub-schema (she is allowed to view that data on her screen) but not other sub-schema. That means she cannot, for example, access how much an employee earns, or the contents of their personnel file. Using the DDL, then, different users of a database can be allowed to access certain sub-schema but not others.&nbsp; Users can be given different ‘views’ of the same data in a database.</p>
<p class="NormalContent"><strong class="NormalContentHeading">Data Manipulation Language (DML)</strong><br> The DML is another important part of the DBMS. It is commonly used by the users of a database to access and update data. This language allows users to actually work on the data in your database. They could, for example, write programs that add, delete, modify or retrieve data! The DML is a very high level language. This ensures that minimal programming skills are necessary to actually use it. You will see and get some experience of a DML when you use SQL.</p>
